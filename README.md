# cat-breed-classifier

An image classification project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify cat breeds from images. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this model is trained on a diverse set of cat images sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The Cat Breed Classifier is designed to predict the breed of a cat given an image. It uses a CNN architecture trained on a labeled dataset of cat images.

- Dataset: [Cat Breeds Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset)
- Model: Custom CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Goal: Classify images into one of several cat breeds
- Platform: Developed and tested on Google Colab

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Google Colab 
- NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## Features

- Cat image classification with breed prediction
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Accuracy tracking, confusion matrix, and performance plots

## How to Run

1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset (unzipped or as a .zip and extract it in Colab)  
3. Run all cells to train the model  
4. Try predicting using test images
